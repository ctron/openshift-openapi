# OpenShift API for Rust

This crate is a Rust OpenShift API client. It contains bindings for the
resources and operations in the OpenShift client API,
auto-generated from the OpenAPI spec.

This work is based on the wonderful work from https://github.com/Arnavion/k8s-openapi

**Note**: This currently uses a patched version `k8s-openapi`. A few changed to the
code generator had been necessary. Use at your own risk!
